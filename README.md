# Lending_Club_Loan_Default_Analysis
This project attempts to examine and analyze the publicly available default dataset of Lending Club's loans starting from 2007 through 2018. The end goal is to build a machine learning model that could accurately predict the likelihood of loan default using known borrower characteristics.
